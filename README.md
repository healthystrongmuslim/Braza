Collection of stuff I've made either as uni work, or just while pondering.

All files would be including the header file stdc++.h,
which includes lots of pre-made libraries,
as well as a few functions and constants I've made for my own convenience
It would be ideal for you to download that before any other file.

Most work I add here would have colour codes used in strings, which work as intended on Mac and Linux terminals,
but do not display correctly on most IDEs' console outputs, and might not work on Windows at all.

If that is an issue, try removing the color code (starts with \33 and ends with m)
  e.g if this is a problematic string: "uncolored\33[(WHATEVER IS IN BETWEEN)mcolored"
  the new string would be: "uncoloredcolored"
